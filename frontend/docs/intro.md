# Content Guidelines for Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Textbook

These guidelines ensure consistency, scientific rigor, ethical responsibility, and pedagogical effectiveness across all content in the "Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics" textbook.

## 1. Scientific Accuracy & Research Standards

*   **Standard**: All content MUST rely exclusively on peer-reviewed academic publications and established scientific consensus.
*   **Avoidance**: Content must be free from speculation, pseudoscience, or unvalidated methods (Constitutional Principle 2, FR-007).
*   **Conflicting Sources**: When conflicting scientific or technical sources exist, present both viewpoints objectively, citing each, and explain why one is favored (if applicable) (FR-019).
*   **Citation Style**: All research and references MUST use the IEEE (Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers) citation style (FR-018).

## 2. Ethical & Safety Considerations

*   **Emphasis**: All content MUST promote safe design, deployment, and control of physical robots, especially humanoids (Constitutional Principle 5, FR-010).
*   **Integration**: Safety-critical considerations (stability, compliance, protective systems) must be explicitly integrated into chapters.
*   **Prohibition**: The textbook shall not encourage risky experiments, unsafe practices, or designs incompatible with standard robotics safety protocols (Constitutional Principle 7).
*   **AI Framing**: AI must always be framed as augmenting human ability, not replacing or undermining human roles (Constitutional Principle 7).

## 3. Pedagogical & Writing Quality

*   **Clarity & Accessibility**: Use clear, accessible, academically sound language, building concepts progressively from first principles (Constitutional Principle 7, FR-011).
*   **Modularity**: Maintain modular sections allowing chapters to be reused in multiple teaching environments.
*   **Tone**: Maintain a neutral academic tone—no personal opinion, hype, or marketing language.
*   **Theory + Application**: Every chapter MUST integrate theory with practical application, including diagrams, exercises, and real-world examples (Constitutional Principle 4, FR-009).

## 4. AI-Assisted Content Development

*   **Assistance**: AI tools may assist with drafting, explanation, illustration, and code generation (Constitutional Principle 8).
*   **Review & Validation**: No AI-generated content is considered final until human-reviewed and validated for accuracy and pedagogical value (Constitutional Principle 8).
*   **Code Verification**: Generated code (snippets, examples) MUST be tested and validated in real or simulated environments.
*   **Priority**: AI assistance must never override pedagogical clarity or safety considerations.

## 5. Tool-Agnosticism

*   **Focus**: The textbook MUST remain tool-agnostic; focus on principles that endure beyond specific hardware, software, or commercial platforms (Constitutional Principle 3, FR-008).
*   **Examples**: When specific tools (e.g., ROS 2, Gazebo, Unity, NVIDIA Isaac, OpenAI Whisper) are discussed, they serve as concrete examples to illustrate enduring principles, not as mandates for specific implementations.
